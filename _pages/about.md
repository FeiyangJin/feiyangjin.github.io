**Actively looking for full-time software engineer opportunies starting August 2025**

Hi everyone, I am currently a 5th-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech. My advisor is [Vivek Sarkar](https://vsarkar.cc.gatech.edu/). Prior to my Ph.D. journey, I earned my bachelor degree from [Washington University in St. Louis](https://washu.edu/) in December 2019.

My research area is dynamic HPC/Parallel program analysis. My Ph.D. thesis focused on understanding, detecting and fixing data races in parallel programs. I have developed several dynamic debugging tools for [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/) and [HClib](https://github.com/habanero-rice/hclib) programs. Additionaly, my reserach achieves theoretical breakthroughs and utilizes Large Language Model in industrial settings.
